IaC was not functional in the project at that time due to significant discrepancies between the Terraform code and the current state, which was managed manually. IaC is a technique where code manages infrastructure, including applications and programs. In this case, the infrastructure changes were made manually without corresponding changes in the Terraform code. If we ran this code, all manual changes would be overwritten, and we would lose our infrastructure. To solve this problem, we redesigned the code and deployed a separate new infrastructure, to which we then transferred our project and removed the old infrastructure.',
