      Minimum viable product MVP

      Before investing a considerable amount of money in building software, hiring personnel and acquiring
      minibuses, GoDee wanted to develop an MVP to understand
      the market fit potential.

    <LazyCaseStudiesUITextParagraph class="m-24_bottom">
      Although services such as GoDee exist in other parts of the world, simulating these programs in Ho Chi Minh
      City was pointless because the city’s commuting culture is quite different. That’s why user feedback was
      crucial to its improvement and key to its current rapid growth.

            Over the time period of three months, our integrated live chat feature collected extensive feedback
            from users to make white-collar workers’ commutes easier.

            This feature enabled GoDee to analyse the actual demand for travel to various Ho Chi Minh City
            districts.
