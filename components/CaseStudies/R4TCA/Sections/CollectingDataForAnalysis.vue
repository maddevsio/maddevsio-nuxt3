        Collecting data for analysis

        The real challenge with paper-based documentation that includes hundreds of Initial Approach Questionnaires was not only related to the time it took to draft it. It was also about what happened to the data collected. There were no plans to digitise the inputs. Technically, all the reports would eventually sit in the NPM's offices and collect dust.

        Instead, a unified regional data collection platform made adding, storing, processing, and sharing data possible, convenient, and accessible for subsequent analysis.

        The R4TCA project is funded by the EU, with the overarching goal of facilitating economic development in the Central Asian region. Therefore, choosing Mad Devs, a development team whose developers are located in the region was all but natural. With that, ITC contributed to the growing innovative, export-oriented software development sector.

        Sustainability

      <LazyCaseStudiesUITextParagraph class="m-24_bottom media-m-12_bottom">
        Sustainability is one of the key paradigms of the R4TCA project. Digital transformation efforts initiated by the ITC have greatly contributed to sustainability through innovative efforts by Mad Devs in a twofold format.

        However, the sustainability wave does not dissipate with the above. The augmented and customized versions of the digital platform would enhance and contribute to sustainability in the subsequent global initiatives, too.

        We consider the development of this digital manual to be not an expense, but an investment. The automation of reporting means that the project can be replicated and that its mission is easier to achieve.
