          The project entailed multiple improvements to ensure its success. We implemented and optimized many processes
          and tools to ensure transparency and data-driven results. The architecture was mainly transformed into
          microservices for greater scalability and ease of management. The team worked on bug fixing,
          autotest integration, and infrastructure upgrades. Existing services were improved, and new ones were
          developed to enhance the user experience. Finally, the design library was updated to make
          the future design simpler and better, and a dark theme was added to give users a choice of visual style.
          All improvements positively affected the costs, speed, and quality of development and the effect will only
          get bigger with the company's growth.
