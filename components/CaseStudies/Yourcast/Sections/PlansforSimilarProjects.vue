      progressing towards a modern entertainment platform.

      The platform will remain the one-and-only NDA-protected project. However, Yourcast.TV is fully open source and can
      serve as a foundation for other video streaming services, assuming monetisation through subscription or

      industry will be able to orchestrate back-end technologies of any complexity.
