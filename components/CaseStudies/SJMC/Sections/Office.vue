        Custom small-scale version of the SJMC in Mad Devs’ office

        As thousands of kilometres separate the SJMC and Mad Devs’ office, a unique approach to the engineering
        partnership was required.

        After purchasing the required equipment and reading code and documentation, in one month after understanding
        the complexity of the SJMC, Mad Devs’ DevOps and back-end engineers built a custom small-scale version of the
        SJMC complex multimedia environment. Thus, testing and deploying new content and changes in the Brain was made
        possible even kilometres away from the real SJMC.
