      According to the internal CSAT survey, 98% of Mad Devs' customers find the company's service great value for
      money, and most of them stay with us for 3+ years. The SJMC is no exception.

      We are honoured to extend our partnership to improve the SJMC visitors' experience by introducing the iPadOS
      application for children. This application will offer engaging content which allows children to discover the
      centre and its resources through a series of educational games. Moreover, Mad Devs is going to develop a
      sophisticated content management system that is eventually going to simplify the deployment of new content and
      will enable the managers of the SJMC themselves to make the required changes with ease.
