        The outcome of the work completed by the Mad Devs team is a fully-fledged platform where users can build
        partnerships, make agreements, pay, and get paid. BandPay safeguards its users and ensures that everyone
        remains satisfied with the final results, such as the desired deliverables and timely payments.

        While working on the BandPay solution, we managed to simplify onboarding and improve project visibility.

        Easy onboarding
      </h4>
      <LazyCaseStudiesUITextParagraph class="m-24_bottom media-m-12_bottom">
        To facilitate the onboarding process, we prepared sufficient project documentation and adopted
        a containerisation strategy using Docker container technology. Once assigned, a developer, be it a frontend
        or backend engineer, can quickly test and deploy the project regardless of the operating system.
        In addition, we obtained good test coverage for the code (65% coverage for 82,000 lines of the backend code).

        Consequently, it takes around 2 days to onboard a new team member in the BandPay project,
        while in other projects, the onboarding process may last up to 2 weeks.

        Increased project visibility

        Mad Devs works in close collaboration with our partners from Peklo, a digital marketing studio engaged
        in BandPay’s marketing strategies and campaigns, including metrics and analytics. Our engineers implemented
        a variety of metrics in the iOS and Android applications to improve the visibility of the project.
      </LazyCaseStudiesUITextParagraph>
      <LazyCaseStudiesUITextParagraph>
        We added a news feed, which shows all recent activities on the platform, such as successful and unsuccessful
        payouts, generated agreements, registered and banned accounts, as well as other activities and events.
        We also added regular reports that provide information about the key metrics and alerts that notify about errors.

        As a result, BandPay is 100% visible and transparent for both the business owner and developers, who can see
        everything happening in the project. This system allows for tracking the activity of the users and collecting
        their feedback in real time. Moreover, our developers can instantly detect and fix problems, even before users
        report them. For this purpose, we extensively apply Sentry.io—a helpful tool for error handling and alerting.
