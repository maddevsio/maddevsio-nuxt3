      Who can benefit most from BandPay?
    </h3>
    <LazyCaseStudiesUITextParagraph class="m-24_bottom media-m-12_bottom">
      BandPay is a milestone based payments platform that takes on the duties of a project manager,
      a lawyer, and an accounting officer, enabling people to run their business effectively.
      This service is well suited for artists, musicians, designers,
      and freelancers and businesses that choose project-based cooperation.

      The project’s initial idea was to help people from the music industry, such as musicians,
      singers, or songwriters, receive payment for their work. Unfair practices are common in this industry,
      so one of the problems music bands face is that they don’t get paid by clients who hire them.
      Thus the name “BandPay”. Nevertheless, the project gradually expanded with time and became a handy tool
      for freelancers working in various fields, not necessarily the music industry.

      BandPay addresses the needs and interests of both the client (buyer) and the contractor (seller).
      On the one hand, it makes sure the contractor is paid; on the other hand,
      no money will be transferred unless the work is completed.
      The parties can specify all conditions and responsibilities in an online contract to protect each other
      from negligence and misbehaviour.

      Mad Devs was chosen to bring the BandPay project to life,
      which we did successfully by creating the entire solution from scratch, including the infrastructure, backend,
      iOS and Android applications, and web components
