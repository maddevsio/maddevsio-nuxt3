      Why the city needed a better taxi service
    </h2>
    <LazyCaseStudiesUITextParagraph class="m-12_bottom">
      Before Namba Taxi, people in Bishkek had two options if they needed a taxi: a private driver or a dispatcher-operated service. Arbitrary rates and the need to hitchhike made the service unreliable and inconvenient for a modern city resident who wants to plan their schedule and make it to places on time. Dispatcher-based systems, in turn, lack efficiency: the intermediary between the passenger and the driver makes the whole process overly time-consuming.

      Automation of the driver-passenger interactions is what Namba Taxi decided to pursue. Mad Devsâ€™ mission is to
      automate as many interactions as possible: we want to let machines do everything that they can do better than
      humans. Namba Taxi wanted an automated, next-generation, Uber-like transportation solution. We undertook the
      challenge of developing this software. We undertook the challenge of developing this software and started in 2013.
