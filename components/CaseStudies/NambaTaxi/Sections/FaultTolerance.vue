        We invested much effort in the architecture because we wanted to do things right, right from the start. A taxi
        service needs a highly flexible and failproof system to rely on. The numbers of requests to process and
        operations to run can vary remarkably depending on both regular factors, like rush hours, and unpredictable
        ones, like the weather. Here is the relevant data collected during our work on the project.

        Given the requirements and the limitations, we decided to implement a one-core architecture using multiple
        technologies and open-source software with no OS- or device-related restrictions.

        Ruby has Ruby-SMPP that deals with the SMPP protocol to receive and send text messages. We needed Node.js
        because of Socket.IO that enables real-time messaging. Turning to open-source software and choosing to develop a
        web application meant that staff could work remotely and it was no longer necessary to spend money on switching
        equipment or licences. So we could attract more customers.

        To build the backend part of the web application, we chose Django as a flexible and secure development tool that
        provided for efficient client-server interactions in a request-response mode. Due to its high scalability,
        Django could easily cope with heavy traffic processing multiple requests from the users and quickly responding
        to them. As a result, the application could run smoothly even during high-demand periods.

        Twisted was another component that we added to our web application’s architecture to make the remote system’s
        communications faster and more reliable. As a scalable event-driven engine, Twisted can handle numerous requests
        simultaneously. SMS notifications for clients were sent to drivers, i.e. our Twisted sent requests to Django
        through a Ruby daemon and then processed requests through the SMS provider’s centre (SMSC).

        Instead of making phone calls, clients could now place an order by a text message. The messages they sent
        reached the SMSC first. After that, we picked up the message using a Ruby daemon and made a POST request. We
        chose the POST request method as a secure way of transmitting sensitive data provided by the app users. Finally,
        the POST requests were sent to Django that processed the received messages.

        Operators’ two work processes were to accept orders and to handle telephone calls. All orders come to Django via
        POST requests; Django then saves a Percona order and sends it to a specific Redis channel that is listening to
        Node.js. Next, the information is sent to the operators’ broadcast channel.

        The simplest part of our system automates managers’ work. The core components here are Django and Percona—an
        open-source database management system. This helps managers to deal with large amounts of information, such as
        orders, client and driver databases, in a prompt and easy manner. Django collects data from Percona and sends it
        to Excel or to the browser.

        Moving to the new software was difficult, and we learned many lessons from it. The transition took seven days
        and taught us to make better use of our frameworks and to create more realistic, reliable load tests.
        Admittedly, we lost about 8% of orders that week, but we brought the waiting time for passengers from 8 down to
        5 minutes.

      >
        Quick growth ensued, presenting a new round of challenges. We needed to constantly introduce changes and
        improvements to ensure that the system could handle the load. For example, we used Sentinel at some point to
        provide fault tolerance for Redis. Later, we switched to Asterisk 11.5 as the telephone exchange to manage GSM
        gateways and providers. When we discovered that Asterisk had trouble bridging audio between devices, we moved to
        FreeSWITCH. We were constantly perfecting the system.
