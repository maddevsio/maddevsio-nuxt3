        To help the women of Turkmenistan take care of their health, Saglyk created the Bilim app. According to expert
        forecasts for 2022, 6.16 million people live in Turkmenistan, and 50.8% of them are women. The applicationâ€™s
        target audience is reproductive-aged women (between roughly 15 and 50 years of age) who primarily speak Turkmen.

        Educating women about their health and rights is challenging because many factors must be considered,
        such as education levels, cultural and religious traditions, and social environments.
        Therefore, it is important to use accurate vocabulary and to be careful in handling culturally taboo
        and sensitive topics. The app is only available in the Turkmen language because Russian-speaking Turkmen
        have access to apps in Russian. With these factors in mind, Saglyk developed the first version of the Bilim app.
        However, with time, they faced problems that required

          reaching out to other development companies.

        The first version of the application looked much like other period tracker apps, but Saglyk wanted to scale
        up and improve the application. They wanted to partner with a company whose already established
        processes could take this project to the next level and transform into a turnkey project.
        They organized a tender for software companies to decide who would be involved in this project.
        From all the applicants, Saglyk chose Mad Devs because their team offered detailed terms, an understanding of
        the country, and proven qualifications before starting the revamping process.
