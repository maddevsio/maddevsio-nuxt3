        After three months of application development, Mad Devs successfully released the new version of the
        Bilim app on the Google Play Store on Jun 22, 2022. During this time, sound development processes
        were established to take this project to the next level and make it a turnkey project.
        To reach all of Saglyk’s goals, Mad Devs upgraded the application backend, improved existing features,
        and fixed existing defects. Additionally, the team developed a set of new requested features.
        They created excellent opportunities for content management, storing user data, collecting end-user feedback,
        and recovering user data. To make the communication process smoother and more transparent,
        they united the team under one communication channel. For Mad Devs, it was a pleasure to contribute to
        Saglyk’s mission; likewise, Saglyk appreciated their professionalism.
